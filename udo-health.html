      <p>In the summer of 2022 I just graduated from LeWagon Bootcamp in Berlin, Germany, when one of my former classmates
        approached me with an interesting proposition: to join him on a team of three Co-Founders with the goal of developing a
        mobile application in the Health Care Sector. With an outline of the project we got accepted to receive a 6-month
        scholarship at the Future Health Care Accelerator of BIA Berlin. </p>
