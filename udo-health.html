        <p class="lg:px-20 md:text-justify text-lg">In the summer of 2022 I just graduated from
          <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/de/berlin" target="_blank" class="link-styles">LeWagon Bootcamp in Berlin</a>,
          Germany, when one of my former classmates approached me with an interesting proposition: to join him on a team of three
          Co-Founders with the goal of developing a mobile application in the Health Care Sector. With an outline of the project we
          got accepted to receive a 6-month scholarship at the Future Health Care Accelerator of
          <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/de/berlin" target="_blank" class="link-styles">BIA Berlin</a>.
          <br><br> The challenge for us was to develop the best possible product as fast as possible. So we went from the initial
          planning including customer personas, business model canvas to user journeys, gathering feedback and ultimately designing
          the app in Figma, creating a working design Prototype. The idea was to create an app that lets the user keep track of
          their own medical data, therefore never losing any of their health related data again and being able to communicate their
          medical history easily with any treating physician. This would empower the individual and lead to better medical treatment in
          the long run. </p>

        <p class="md:w-7/12 inline-block text-lg">After wracking our brains and gathering enough data about what kind of product we wanted to build,
          it was clear that we wanted to build an app that
          was light and easy to use, emphasizing user experience over pure functionality and therefore creating a user experience that
          would invoke pleasant feelings from the user and invite the user to continuous use. This was opposed to the existing
          competition on the market that was overwhelmingly painted in subdued color schemes, predominantly using white, blue and green.
          <br><br> Using Figma I started with a simple design held in very light colors with a soft and friendly feel.

        <img src="images/Iteration_udo.png" alt="bia" class="md:hidden rounded-2xl mb-10">
        <p class="md:w-7/12 inline-block text-lg">From that first Design we started to gather successively more feedback from test users and iterate
          the Design from there. Having a clear vision of what I wanted the app to look like, while incorporating the feedback from
          users took a few iteration cycles and resulted in a first working Design for the UDO App.
          <br><br> The main challenge at this point in the Development was to bring common Design principles such as contrasting
          color scheme, easy to read typeface and intuitive button placement together with our image of an app, that makes Health
          looks cute and playful. After trying many different colors, shades and layouts slowly the final version of the app began
          to take shape.  </p>

        <p class="md:w-7/12 inline-block text-lg">The final and finished protoype started to take shape towards the end of our stint at BIA.
          Going from the initial first Design, many changes found itself incorporated into the final Design, but also some constants
          that I managed to keep, like the light color scheme using pink and a very light pastel blue. Many of the Additional
          features like the reward system were added in later stages of the development as users seemed to really connect
          with the concept of gamification.
          <br> <br> To give the user an understanding of how the finished app works the screens are fully clickable and
          connected in a Figma protoype. The final Figma protoype can be found on Figma for experimentation and inspiration.
